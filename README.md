Project Groot is a from-scratch implementation of a Transformer-based language model in PyTorch, designed to explore the space of Large Language Models (LLMs)
through careful architectural choices, training stability experiments and new optimization techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> Just like the Marvel character Groot appears in different forms and sizes, this project is designed to scale from Groot Tiny → Groot Small → Groot Medium → Groot Large, while keeping the core architecture and principles consistent.
